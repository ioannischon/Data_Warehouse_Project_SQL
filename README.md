# Data Warehouse Project in SQL

Welcome to the 'Data Warehouse Project in SQL' repository. 
----------------------------------------------------------

This project is designed and demonstrated as an extensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating useful analytical insights. It is a part of portfolio projects aiming to highlight industry's best practices and needs in data engineering and analytics. 

It is built with the 'Medallion Structure' of three separate layers: 
  
  - Bronze Layer or Schema: The Data insert the schema exactly as they are in the source system. 
  - Silver Layer or Schema: Tha Data get cleaned and standardized in order to avoid bad data quality, but the structure of the model remains untouchable.
  - Gold Layer or Schema: The data get aggregated in a useful and business intelligent way, so the whole model is generated from scratch.

The Data Architecture of the whole project is the following:
